# Cancer Severity Prediction & Treatment Cost Analysis (2015â€“2024)

### The objective of this project is to analyze global cancer patient data collected between 2015 and 2024 to better understand the key factors influencing cancer diagnosis, severity, treatment costs, and patient survival outcomes. This analysis aims to provide actionable insights that can support healthcare decision-making and resource allocation.

### Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide, with multiple factors affecting patient prognosis and healthcare costs. Early detection and personalized treatment strategies are critical to improving patient outcomes and optimizing medical expenses. However, the complexity of these factors requires advanced data analysis and machine learning models to uncover hidden patterns and predictive signals.
